# Vue Mastery Example Event App

## Following along?

We encourage you to follow the course on Vue Mastery, and code along with us. This course has tags representing the start and finish of each lesson, just in case you get stuck.

Here are the commands you’ll want handy once you have it installed. I’m assuming you already have npm installed.

To install dependencies:

```
    $ npm install
```

To run the server:

```
    $ npm run serve
```

To get json-server, which we use for our mock database (Starting on API calls with Axios)

```
    $ npm install -g json-server
```

To run the mock database

```
    $ json-server --watch db.json
```
